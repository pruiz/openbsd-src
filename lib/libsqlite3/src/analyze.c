*************************************************************************
** This file contains code associated with the ANALYZE command.
**
** The ANALYZE command gather statistics about the content of tables
** and indices.  These statistics are made available to the query planner
** to help it make better decisions about how to perform queries.
**
** The following system tables are or have been supported:
**
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat1(tbl, idx, stat);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat2(tbl, idx, sampleno, sample);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat3(tbl, idx, nEq, nLt, nDLt, sample);
**    CREATE TABLE sqlite_stat4(tbl, idx, nEq, nLt, nDLt, sample);
**
** Additional tables might be added in future releases of SQLite.
** The sqlite_stat2 table is not created or used unless the SQLite version
** is between 3.6.18 and 3.7.8, inclusive, and unless SQLite is compiled
** with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2.  The sqlite_stat2 table is deprecated.
** The sqlite_stat2 table is superseded by sqlite_stat3, which is only
** created and used by SQLite versions 3.7.9 and later and with
** SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT3 defined.  The functionality of sqlite_stat3
** is a superset of sqlite_stat2.  The sqlite_stat4 is an enhanced
** version of sqlite_stat3 and is only available when compiled with
** SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT4 and in SQLite versions 3.8.1 and later.  It is
** not possible to enable both STAT3 and STAT4 at the same time.  If they
** are both enabled, then STAT4 takes precedence.
**
** For most applications, sqlite_stat1 provides all the statisics required
** for the query planner to make good choices.
**
** Format of sqlite_stat1:
**
** There is normally one row per index, with the index identified by the
** name in the idx column.  The tbl column is the name of the table to
** which the index belongs.  In each such row, the stat column will be
** a string consisting of a list of integers.  The first integer in this
** list is the number of rows in the index.  (This is the same as the
** number of rows in the table, except for partial indices.)  The second
** integer is the average number of rows in the index that have the same
** value in the first column of the index.  The third integer is the average
** number of rows in the index that have the same value for the first two
** columns.  The N-th integer (for N>1) is the average number of rows in 
** the index which have the same value for the first N-1 columns.  For
** a K-column index, there will be K+1 integers in the stat column.  If
** the index is unique, then the last integer will be 1.
**
** The list of integers in the stat column can optionally be followed
** by the keyword "unordered".  The "unordered" keyword, if it is present,
** must be separated from the last integer by a single space.  If the
** "unordered" keyword is present, then the query planner assumes that
** the index is unordered and will not use the index for a range query.
** 
** If the sqlite_stat1.idx column is NULL, then the sqlite_stat1.stat
** column contains a single integer which is the (estimated) number of
** rows in the table identified by sqlite_stat1.tbl.
**
** Format of sqlite_stat2:
**
** The sqlite_stat2 is only created and is only used if SQLite is compiled
** with SQLITE_ENABLE_STAT2 and if the SQLite version number is between
** 3.6.18 and 3.7.8.  The "stat2" table contains additional information
** about the distribution of keys within an index.  The index is identified by
** the "idx" column and the "tbl" column is the name of the table to which
** the index belongs.  There are usually 10 rows in the sqlite_stat2
** table for each index.
**
** The sqlite_stat2 entries for an index that have sampleno between 0 and 9
** inclusive are samples of the left-most key value in the index taken at
** evenly spaced points along the index.  Let the number of samples be S
** (10 in the standard build) and let C be the number of rows in the index.
** Then the sampled rows are given by:
**
**     rownumber = (i*C*2 + C)/(S*2)
**
** For i between 0 and S-1.  Conceptually, the index space is divided into
** S uniform buckets and the samples are the middle row from each bucket.
**
** The format for sqlite_stat2 is recorded here for legacy reference.  This
** version of SQLite does not support sqlite_stat2.  It neither reads nor
** writes the sqlite_stat2 table.  This version of SQLite only supports
** sqlite_stat3.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat3:
**
** The sqlite_stat3 format is a subset of sqlite_stat4.  Hence, the
** sqlite_stat4 format will be described first.  Further information
** about sqlite_stat3 follows the sqlite_stat4 description.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat4:
**
** As with sqlite_stat2, the sqlite_stat4 table contains histogram data
** to aid the query planner in choosing good indices based on the values
** that indexed columns are compared against in the WHERE clauses of
** queries.
**
** The sqlite_stat4 table contains multiple entries for each index.
** The idx column names the index and the tbl column is the table of the
** index.  If the idx and tbl columns are the same, then the sample is
** of the INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.  The sample column is a blob which is the
** binary encoding of a key from the index.  The nEq column is a
** list of integers.  The first integer is the approximate number
** of entries in the index whose left-most column exactly matches
** the left-most column of the sample.  The second integer in nEq
** is the approximate number of entries in the index where the
** first two columns match the first two columns of the sample.
** And so forth.  nLt is another list of integers that show the approximate
** number of entries that are strictly less than the sample.  The first
** integer in nLt contains the number of entries in the index where the
** left-most column is less than the left-most column of the sample.
** The K-th integer in the nLt entry is the number of index entries 
** where the first K columns are less than the first K columns of the
** sample.  The nDLt column is like nLt except that it contains the 
** number of distinct entries in the index that are less than the
** sample.
**
** There can be an arbitrary number of sqlite_stat4 entries per index.
** The ANALYZE command will typically generate sqlite_stat4 tables
** that contain between 10 and 40 samples which are distributed across
** the key space, though not uniformly, and which include samples with
** large nEq values.
**
** Format for sqlite_stat3 redux:
**
** The sqlite_stat3 table is like sqlite_stat4 except that it only
** looks at the left-most column of the index.  The sqlite_stat3.sample
** column contains the actual value of the left-most column instead
** of a blob encoding of the complete index key as is found in
** sqlite_stat4.sample.  The nEq, nLt, and nDLt entries of sqlite_stat3
** all contain just a single integer which is the same as the first
** integer in the equivalent columns in sqlite_stat4.
